June 1, 2020</h2>

<p style="font-family:calibri;">A couple of months ago, I was offered an opportunity to go to space, specifically a tour around the <mark>solar system</mark>. After reading through all the information given, I have decided to accept the offer. Here I am standing in front of a space shuttle ready to go on my new journey. I read several articles about how to survive in space as well as finding some fun facts to look and think about.</p>

July 1, 2020</h2> 

<p style="font-family:calibri;">After the first month of being in a space shuttle with other people, which I have not mentioned, it feels like I have lost interest in this trip. Some of the fun parts that have happened were actually being able to land on and walk on certain moons &amp; planets. Otherwise, it was usually an instructor who would talk to us about a certain asteroid, moon, or planet for what felt like an hour at a time. When there was free time, there was not much else to do except wait until the next lecture about another ball of rock and gas. All we could do to pass time between the lectures was eat &amp; sleep. I had high hopes for going to space, but now they are gone.</p>

August 1, 2020</h2>

<p style="font-family:calibri;">This was the final day that we had of this expedition. At this point, I felt like I have lost my mind. Anyone who wants to learn about space by experiencing it, I would not recommend it. While I may not of enjoyed the trip, I have learned more about space and the trip was something to experience.</p>
